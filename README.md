# RPG Shooter 2D in Unity

## Introduction
This is our mid-semester project for Game Development course at HCMUS year 2021-2022. This project started with an idea of our favorite childhood games Soul Knight and BoxHead, and then finished for over a week with little of knowledge about Unity and C#. Fortunately, there are many documents and tutorials all over the internet which helps us progress by whole lot. We first came up with some idea then researched for how to do it, then did it and faced more challenges and repeat the process. Althogh it is still buggy, we are rewarded with knowledge and it worths our time.

## Description
